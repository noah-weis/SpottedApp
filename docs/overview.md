# Project Overview

**Spotted App** is a lightweight social mobile app designed for quick and fun interactions among friends.

## Core

Users can:

- Open the app to a live camera view
- Capture a photo or short video of someone they've spotted
- Tag that person
- Send the “spot” to a group feed or notify the individual

This creates spontaneous, playful interactions while encouraging real-life social connection.

## Key Features (MVP)

- Camera-first interface
- User tagging
- Shared group feed
- Notifications for being “spotted”
- Stats and leaderboards (planned)
